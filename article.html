        <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement, based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to use for communication proposed by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev. The scale has three designated categories:</p>
        <br>
        <ol style="color: white; font-size:22px;">
  <li>A Type I civilization - also called a planetary civilization-can use and store all of the energy which reaches its planet from its parent star.</li></br>
  <li>A Type II civilization - also called a stellar civilization-can harness the total energy of its planet's parent star (the most popular hypothetical concept being the Dyson sphere - a device which would encompass the entire star and transfer its energy to the planet).</li></br>
  <li>A Type III civilization â€” also called a galactic civilization-can control energy on the scale of its entire host galaxy.</li></br>
</ol>
